      <h1>Offer your Customers Trustworthy Energy</h1>
      <p>The energy industry is facing a time of severe change.
        Faith in energy companies is rapidly falling, and consumer disloyalty is at an all-time high.
        Customers are demanding more from companies in terms of choice, transparency, and trust.
        RenBloc can now offer the level of transparency that your customers are craving,
        building a truly loyal customer base!

      <h1>Become Truly Renewable</h1>
      <p>Energy usage in buildings accounts for a large part of our total climate impact. Lowering our energy consumption is of
        the utmost importance for reaching our target climate goals.
        Utilizing RenBloc allows you to take smart buildings to the next level.
        We make energy usage more efficient by allowing industry and property owners to distribute
        energy where it is needed, as well as deciding from where that energy is sourced.

      <h3>This is Renbloc</h3>
      <p>The idea for RenBloc was sprung over a kitchen table in the winter of 2017.</p>
      <p>Founders Gustaf Svensson and Nils Söderström made the switch to 100% renewable energy contracts,
        however we realized that they had no way of verifying, nor tracing, what was actually being delivered.
        We set out to change this – empowering consumers to freely choose their type of energy – changing the market forever!
        Since then we have partnered with major energy companies, as well as launched our first product,
        proving that not being able to trace your energy is a thing of the past!</p>
